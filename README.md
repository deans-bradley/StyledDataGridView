# Styled DataGridView
This repo contains a simple styled DataGridView for Windows Forms in .NET 8.0. I have already hard-coded ``Car`` objects to populate the DataGridView to save time if you would like to experiment with the visual style of the DataGrid. 
## Setup
Open command prompt on your local machine and enter the following git command to clone this repo:
``git clone https://github.com/deans-bradley/StyledDataGridView.git``
Open Visual Studio and select **Open a project or solution**.
Locate the repo folder and open the Visual Studio solution ``StyledDataGrid.sln``.
That's it! Happy coding!
